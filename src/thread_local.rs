///
/// ```
/// let x = rand::random::<u8>();
/// println!("{}", x);
///
/// if rand::random() { // generates a boolean
///     println!("Better lucky than good!");

///
/// ```
/// use rand::{Rand, Default};
///
/// let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
///
/// for x in v.iter_mut() {
///     *x = rand::random()
/// }
///
/// // would be faster as
///
/// let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
///
/// for x in v.iter_mut() {
///     *x = Rand::rand(&mut rng, Default);

/// ```
/// use rand::random_with;
/// use rand::distributions::{Rand, Default, Uniform01, Closed01, Range};

/// // identical to calling `random()`:
/// let x: f64 = random_with(Default);
