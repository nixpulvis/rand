//! Alternative design for `Range`.
//! 
//! TODO: decide whether to replace the old `range` module with this.
//! Advantage: float ranges don't have to store a "zone" parameter.
//! Advantage: custom implementations can store extra parameters.
//! Possible advantage: easier implementations for custom types written in
//! terms of implementations of other types.
//! Disadvantage: complex?
//! 
//! This is *almost* like having separate `RangeInt<T>`, `RangeFloat<T>`,
//! etc. (or just `RangeI32`, etc.) types, each implementing `Distribution`,
//! but it adds some magic to support generic `range` and `new_range` methods.

/// Sample values uniformly between two bounds.
///
/// This gives a uniform distribution (assuming the RNG used to sample
/// it is itself uniform & the `RangeImpl` implementation is correct),
/// even for edge cases like `low = 0u8`,
/// `high = 170u8`, for which a naive modulo operation would return
/// numbers less than 85 with double the probability to those greater
/// than 85.
///
/// Types should attempt to sample in `[low, high)`, i.e., not
/// including `high`, but this may be very difficult. All the
/// primitive integer types satisfy this property, and the float types
/// normally satisfy it, but rounding may mean `high` can occur.
/// 
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use rand::distributions::Distribution;
/// use rand::distributions::range2::Range;
///
/// fn main() {
///     let between = Range::new(10, 10000);
///     let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
///     let mut sum = 0;
///     for _ in 0..1000 {
///         sum += between.sample(&mut rng);
///     }
///     println!("{}", sum);
/// }
